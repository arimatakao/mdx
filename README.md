## FAQ üí¨

#### Where can I get the manga link?

You can find the manga link at mangadex.org. Choose the manga you like and open its page. The link to the manga looks like this:

```
https://mangadex.org/title/abc-123-abc/some-title
```

You can use this link to download chapters of the manga.

#### Where can I get the chapter link?

Go to mangadex.org, choose the manga you like, and open the specific chapter you want. The link to the chapter looks like this:

```
https://mangadex.org/chapter/abc-123-abc
```

You can use this link to download the specific chapter.

#### I can't download chapter X of manga X. Why?

Make sure you have specified the correct language, translation group, and number of chapters. If you are unable to download a specific chapter, try using the direct link to the chapter:

```
mdx dl https://mangadex.org/chapter/abc-123-abc
```

**Remember:** mdx can only download chapters from MangaDex.

#### Why is downloading so slow?

I don't know. It's a problem on MangaDex's side or on your side.

#### I downloaded a chapter but the output filename doesn't have the volume number or chapter number. Why?

This problem stems from the uploader failing to specify the correct volume or chapter details.

#### Why do pages in the PDF have different sizes?

The size of each page in the PDF corresponds to the size of the image.

#### Getting error "While getting manga chapters: request is failed". I can't download anything. Why?

This issue is related to the MangaDex API (https://api.mangadex.org/docs/2-limitations/#general-rate-limit), mdx is sending too many requests per second. Try downloading chapters later.

#### Getting error "Chapters x-y not found, try another range, language, translation group etc."

Maybe you didn't specify the translation group, chapter range, or language correctly. **Make sure that the chapter can be opened on MangaDex (not on external resource).**

Sometimes it doesn't download because of some problems on the MangaDex side. Just try again later.

#### Getting an error in interactive mode when searching for manga. Why?

Because your query should be more than 5 characters to avoid errors.
